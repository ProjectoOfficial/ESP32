## Project Descriptions

### [AM2301 and MQ135 on ESP32](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_AM2301)
This project showcases how to interface AM2301 (DHT22) and MQ135 sensors with ESP32 microcontrollers. Monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality with ease.

### [ESP32 Amplifier and Speaker with SD Card](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_AMPLIFIER/SPEAKER_SD)
Create an audio amplifier system with an ESP32. Play audio files from an SD card and explore audio applications using the ESP32.

### [ESP32 CAM Python Stream with OpenCV](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_CAM_PYTHON_STREAM_OPENCV)
Learn how to create a Python script for streaming video from an ESP32 CAM module using OpenCV. Explore real-time video processing.

### [ESP32 Firebase Services](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_FIREBASE_SERVICES)
Enhance your IoT projects with Firebase integration. Use ESP32 to send and receive data from Firebase, enabling cloud-based control.

### [ESP32 Land Meter](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_LAND_METER)
A project for measuring and monitoring land parameters. Use ESP32 to collect data and present it for analysis and decision-making.

### [ESP32 MQ135](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_MQ135)
A variation of the AM2301 and MQ135 project, this version focuses on MQ135 sensor integration with ESP32 for air quality monitoring.

### [ESP32 Web Server](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP32_WEB_SERVER)
Create your own web server with ESP32.  It allows to directly control a pair of digital GPIO through two buttons inserted on the web page. An LM35 allows to monitor the ambient temperature, which is showed on the web page too. The web server uses Bootstrap framework for rendering the graphics, giving to it an amazing look! More instruction can be found inside .ino file.

### [ESP Motion Detection](https://github.com/ProjectoOfficial/ESP32/tree/main/ESP_MOTION_DETECTION)
Build a motion detection system using ESP32. Monitor and respond to motion events in your environment.
